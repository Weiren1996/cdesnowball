# CDESnowball
Updated version of the ChemDataExtractor toolkit to include Quaternary semi-supervised relationship extraction for
retrieving Curie and Neel phase transition temperatures. This work adds new text and table parsers for Curie and NÃ©el
temperature extraction, updated CEM parsers and the relationship extraction (relex) package.


# Training the system

The default Snowball clusters are provided as .pkl files within the [relex settings](relex/settings/).
The adaptable parameters of the system can be edited in the [settings.py file](relex/settings/settings.py).

Train the Snowball cluster system using the SnowballTrainer class:
```
# Import the Snowball training system
from CDESnowball.relex.train import SnowballTrainer
from CDESnowball.relex.utils inport neel_seeds, temp_value_regex, temp_unit_regex, neel_temperature_specifier_regex

# designate a path to a training corpus HTML/XML files
training_corpus = '//path/to/training/corpus'

# Provide some seeds e.g. the neel temperature seeds provided
seeds = neel_seeds

# Set the minimum relationship confidence
tc = 0.8

# Set the minimum sentence similarity
tsim = 0.8

# train the snowball algorithm
sbt = SnowballTrainer(seeds=s,
                      corpus=training_corpus,
                      tsim=tsim,
                      tc=tc,
                      val_regex=temp_value_regex,
                      unit_regex=temp_unit_regex,
                      spec_regex=neel_temperature_specifier_regex,
                      relationship_name='neel_temperatures')
sbt.train()

````
This will initiate the training sequence. Creating the extraction patterns as .pkl files once completed. The saved files will be in the relex.settings folder


# USAGE
Clone this github repository and run 
'''
python3 setup.py install
''''
Or simply use the code in your own project.

Recommended toolkit usage is with the [magdb](https://github.com/cjcourt/magdb) database creation package.
