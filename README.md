# chemdataextractor-snowball
Updated version of the ChemDataExtractor toolkit to include Quaternary semi-supervised relationship extraction for
retrieving Curie and Neel phase transition temperatures. This work adds new text and table parsers for Curie and NÃ©el
temperature extraction, updated CEM parsers and the relationship extraction (relex) package.


# Training the system

The default Snowball clusters are provided as .pkl files within the [relex settings](relex/settings/). The adaptable parameters of the system can be edited in the [settings.py file](relex/settings/settings.py).

1) Edit the settings file to locate the neel and curie training corpora

2) Train the Snowball cluster system by either running the relex.train.py file or using the import statement:
```
from chemdataextractor_snowball.relex import train
````
This will initiate the training sequence. Creating the extraction patterns as .pkl files once completed.


# USAGE
To use this updated ChemDataExtractor toolkit you must first have the latest ChemDataExtractor build installed
and running. The latest version is available [here](http://chemdataextractor.org/download).

Next, install this updated version as a separate package named chemdataextractor_snowball in your local python3
site-packages directory. Or simply use the code in your own project.

Recommended toolkit usage is with the [magdb](https://github.com/cjcourt/magdb) database creation package.
